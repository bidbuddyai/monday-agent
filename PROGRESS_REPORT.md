## üìù Technical Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Onboarding**: Uses Monday storage API for persistence per instance
2. **File Upload**: Uses multer with memory storage, converts to base64 data URLs
3. **Activity Feed**: Async logAction fetches item names from Monday API
4. **UI Framework**: React with CSS modules, no external UI library
5. **State Management**: React hooks, no Redux needed

### Performance Considerations

- Activity feed limited to 50 recent actions
- File uploads limited to 10MB
- Action log fetches item names asynchronously
- Monday storage used for persistence

### Security

- POE_API_KEY stored in Monday secure storage
- File uploads validated and size-limited
- Monday API token handled securely via context

2. Add persistent knowledge base storage
3. Build knowledge management UI
4. Test all features end-to-end
5. Final deployment and version promotion
