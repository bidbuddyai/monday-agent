## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Architecture Decisions

1. **React + Hooks**: No Redux, clean component state
2. **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling, no conflicts
3. **Monday SDK**: Direct integration for storage and context
4. **Multer**: Backend file uploads with memory storage
5. **Poe API**: OpenAI-compatible endpoint for AI features

### Performance Optimizations

- Activity feed limited to 50 items
- File uploads capped at 10MB
- Async operations for item name fetching
- Monday storage for persistence
- In-memory caching where appropriate

### Security Considerations

- POE_API_KEY in Monday secure storage
- File uploads validated and size-limited
- Monday API token via secure context
- No sensitive data in logs
- CORS properly configured

---
